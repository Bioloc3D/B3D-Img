## üìù Description  
[B3D-Img ImageJ macro](https://github.com/Bioloc3D/B3D-Img/tree/main/B3D-Img) is one of the two components of the [Bioloc3D toolset](https://github.com/orgs/Bioloc3D/repositories), an advanced and user-friendly 3D fluorescence imaging analysis solution. This macro specializes in the precise quantification of colocalizations in 3D by identifying and analyzing fluorescent elements from different channels. Excel files resulting from the macro analysis can be analyzed through the <em>B3D-Plt application</em>.
